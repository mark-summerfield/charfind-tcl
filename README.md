# CharFind

`charfind.tcl` is a GUI Unicode character finder.

Once installed you must create the unicode character database
(`unidata.db`) the application depends on. To do this run:

`prepare_unidata.tcl`

This may take a few seconds to run but need only be done once.

Note: I use [Store](https://github.com/mark-summerfield/store) for version
control so github is only used to make the code public.
