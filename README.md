# CharFind

`charfind.tcl` is a GUI Unicode character finder.

Once installed you need to create the unicode character database
(`unidata.db`) the application depends on. To do this run:

`prepare_unidata.tcl`

This may take a few minutes to run.

control so github is only used to make the code public.
